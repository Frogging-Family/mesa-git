# Uncomment the MESA_WHICH_LLVM variable below to select which LLVM package tree to use by default to build mesa-git against.
# Note that if you're used to have that variable set in ~/.bashrc, you can leave it commented out here. It'll be respected by the PKGBUILD.
# Else, you'll get prompted about it at build time.

# 1: llvm-minimal-git (AUR)
# 2: llvm-git (AUR)

# 4  llvm (stable from extra) Default value

# Compiler to use - gcc or clang - gcc is default

# Which Gallium drivers to include in the build - default is "r300,r600,radeonsi,nouveau,svga,swrast,virgl,iris,zink,crocus".
# As of mesa commit e2de00876a7033b6923f912af8d2b0bbd100e113, swr (which was part of that default list) was removed. You can add it back if building an older commit.
# For users with a dedicated AMD GPU (RX 400 series and newer) the minimum required to get a working display driver is the "radeonsi,svga,swrast" combo

# Set optional additional flags for meson - Defaults are "--strip --buildtype release"
# Can be used for PGO'ing (you need to make a first build with "-Db_pgo=generate" added, then launch your apps/games to generate the gcda profiles in your src dir. Once you feel like you have covered all your desired usecases, replace "-Db_pgo=generate" with "-Db_pgo=use" then rebuild the same commit to get your optimized build).
# (coupling with _no_lto="false" is recommended for PGO builds)
# On legacy toolchains you might encounter coverage mismatch errors with "-Db_pgo=use", that you can workaround by adding "-Wno-coverage-mismatch"
_additional_meson_flags="--strip --buildtype release"

# Custom Mesa commit to pass to Git.

# Mesa branch to pass to Git (when not using a custom commit). Default is "main".

# You can use your own patches by putting them in the same folder as the PKGBUILD and giving them the .mymesapatch extension.
# You can also revert patches by putting them in the same folder as the PKGBUILD and giving them the .mymesarevert extension.

# Also, userpatches variable below must be set to true for the above to work.
